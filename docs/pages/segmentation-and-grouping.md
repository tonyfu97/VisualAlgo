Explanation:
The nerual network model is part of a larger pattern recongition model. It is responsible for the early processing step, up to the figure-ground separation step. It is made up of Feature Contour System (FCS) and the Boundary Contou System (BCS) proposed by Grossberg and Mingolla (1985). Because the sequence of processing is FCS-BCS-FCS, the model is named FCS networks. 

Note that FCS and BCS are characterize by the behavior. The models evolved to be very complex these days, and the exact implementation is often based on papers.

The algorithm is broken up into 4 steps:
