This [repository](https://github.com/tonyfu97/VisualAlgo/) is created purely for educational purposes. It contains implementations of algorithms that might be copyrighted or protected by other legal means. The goal is to showcase these implementations as a personal project and to facilitate learning.

Please note that while you are welcome to browse and learn from this code, I highly discourage using it directly in any production system or for any commercial purposes, as it may infringe upon the rights of the original algorithm authors or patent holders.

For each algorithm implemented, aside from those widely used and commonly known, I have included citations and references to the original papers where they were presented. Always be sure to respect the rights of the original creators and acknowledge their work.
